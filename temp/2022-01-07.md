- `range(n^2, n*(n+1))` contains at least one primes. This is because: as to the array `{n*n, n*n+1, n*n+2, ... ,next_prime(n*n)-1 }`, we can dispatch distinct real factors for every item, these real factors are in `{2,3,4,...,n}` , Pigeonhole principle shows `next_prime(n*n)< n*(n+1)` . Samely, `range(n*(n+1), (n+1)*(n+1))` contains at least one prime. so, this is one sentence proof for
- 

In fact,it holds true that

NextPrime-Square-Inequality; `next_prime_delta(n^2) <= 1+euler_phi(n)`

[((next_prime(n^2)-n^2),n) for n in range(100000,120000)]
